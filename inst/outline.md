# Opening up our minds project

The Project was devised and run by [Lotty Brand](https://lottybrand.wordpress.com/) and [Tom Stafford](https://tomstafford.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/).  
The App was created by [Dan Brady](https://github.com/ubdbra001).

## Overview

The Ideological Turing Test (ITT) is an attempt to measure people's ability to take the perspective of those on the other side of a debate to themselves, by providing arguments for the opposite side (henceforth 'opponents') that "pass" as being written by opponents, in that it is agreed with by the opponents to the same extent as arguments written by opponents.

We explored this with three topics:

-   Veganism
-   The Covid-19 Vaccine
-   Brexit

We asked 100 people from each side of the debate (e.g. vegans/non vegans, pro/anti vaccination, for/against Brexit) to provide three reasons that opponents might give for their position, as well as three reasons for their own position (henceforth 'proponents' position).

We then asked 100 different people from each side of the debate to rate how strongly they agree (on a Likert scale from 1-7) with those reasons for their position - importantly the participants did not know if they were rating reasons written by ideological opponents or proponents.

## Shiny App

This app allows for exploration of the data collected as part of the project, and consists of two parts.

The "__Word clouds__" tab breaks the arguments for a specific topic down into individual words, and uses a word cloud and word frequency graph to visualise which words appear the most often. These visualisations can be customised by using the controls provided to compare across the different conditions for a topic, filter by specific ratings, and exclude specific words.

The "__Raw data__" tab presents all the arguments for a particular topic, allowing users to:

-   View the arguments made for or against a particular topic

-   Explore whether the argument was made by an individual whose views aligned with the argument in question (i.e. whether they were pro or anti that topic)

-   How the arguments were rated (on average) by others who were pro- or anti- that topic
