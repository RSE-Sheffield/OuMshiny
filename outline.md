# Opening up our minds project

Run by [Lotty Brand](https://lottybrand.wordpress.com/) and [Tom Stafford](https://tomstafford.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/)

## Overview

The Ideological Turing Test (ITT) is an attempt to measure people's ability to take the perspective of those on the other side of a debate to themselves, by providing arguments for the opposite side (henceforth 'opponents') that "pass" as being written by opponents, in that it is agreed with by the opponents to the same extent as arguments written by opponents.

We explored this with three topics:

-   Veganism
-   The Covid-19 Vaccine
-   Brexit

We asked 100 people from each side of the debate (e.g. vegans/non vegans, pro/anti vaccination, for/against Brexit) to provide three reasons that opponents might give for their position, as well as three reasons for their own position (henceforth 'proponents' position).

We then asked 100 different people from each side of the debate to rate how strongly they agree (on a Likert scale from 1-7) with those reasons for their position - importantly the participants did not know if they were rating reasons written by ideological opponents or proponents.

## Shiny App

This app then takes the ratings for each argument and calculates the mean rating for that argument.
This allow for the exploration of the data collected as part of the project. Specifically, allowing users to:

-   View the arguments made for or against a particular topic
-   Explore whether the argument was made by an individual whose views aligned with the argument in question (i.e.Â whether they were pro or anti that topic)
-   How the arguments were rated (on average) by others who were pro- or anti- that topic
