# Opening up our Minds (OuM) Shiny App

The purpose of the OuM app is to allow for the exploration of the data
collected as part of the Opening up our Minds project. Specifically, it
allows users to:

- View the arguments made for or against a particular topic

- Explore whether the argument was made by an individual whose views
  aligned with the argument in question (i.e.Â whether they were pro or
  anti that topic)

- How the arguments were rated by others who were pro- or anti- that
  topic.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OuMshiny by
downloading/cloning this repo, and then executing the following commands
in R

``` r
devtools::install('./')
OuMshiny::run_app()
```

## Run the app

Once installed you can run the app locally like so:

``` r
OuMshiny::run_app()
```
